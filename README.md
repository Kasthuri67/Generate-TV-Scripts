# Generate-TV-Scripts

# RNN Project [Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree]

# Project Overview:
This repo contains all my work for Project 2 of Udacity's Neural Network Foundation Nanodegree Program. In this project, I have generated my own Simpsons TV scripts using RNNs. I have used part of the Simpsons dataset of scripts from 27 seasons. The Neural Network I have built will generate a new TV script for a scene at Moe's Tavern.
